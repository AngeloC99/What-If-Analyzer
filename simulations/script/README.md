The output directory should be the one of the visualization tool ("simulations").

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (>= v.3.11.3)

## Run The Script
Open the terminal in this subdirectory of the project and run the following command:
```bash
py total_aggregator_avg.py "<input_directory_path>" "<output_directory_path>"
```
